1. installed but fail to operate through cmd and git bash:
    path problem. Go to "Advanced system settings" - "Environment Variables" and add the corresponding python, pip, or pipenv
    path to the "path" with form:  "%pathofcertaintype%"

2. virtualenv fail to activate:
    (1) try to use cmd instead of git bash.
    (2) follow the following coode:
        > cd C:\Users\pc\Desktop\myfiles      %Before running this line, create a folder called "myfiles" on the Desktop. This line of                                                    code should change the directory to "myfiles".
        > mkdir myproject                     %Create a folder called "myproject" in "myfiles", you can check if it exists before next
        > cd myproject                        %Change working directory to myproject
        > virtualenv env                      %Create a virtual environment called "env"
        > env\Scripts\activate                %Activation
        ...
        > deactivate                          %Deactivation
